# Student Management Program

Student Management Program is a JavaFX desktop application for managing academic records through a menu-driven interface. The project is organized around core university-style entities such as students, departments, instructors, courses, and enrollments, with support for reporting and data validation workflows.

## Overview

The application is structured as a modular desktop system with clear package separation for:

- application bootstrap and shared runtime context
- window launching and shell-level UI
- top-level menu construction and shell-level navigation wiring
- custom collection support for in-memory catalogs
- domain models for academic records
- file-based persistence handlers
- JavaFX feature modules
- reporting
- service integrations

The long-term goal is to provide a clean desktop experience for managing and reviewing academic data from a single application window.

## Current Foundation

The current version includes:

- application startup flow
- shared application context
- JavaFX shell launcher
- top-level menu factory and shell controller
- custom generic list collection
- core domain models for students, departments, instructors, courses, enrollments, and reports
- foundational handler contract for persistence operations
- student, department, instructor, course, and enrollment persistence handlers for flat-file loading and saving

This stage completes the first full pass of the flat-file persistence layer across the core academic entities while keeping the broader CRUD feature modules, reporting screens, shared UI helpers, and service integrations for later pushes.

## Planned Functional Areas

- Student management
- Department management
- Instructor management
- Course management
- Enrollment management
- Academic reports
- ZIP-based location lookup for student records

## Technology

- Java
- JavaFX
- Gson
- Eclipse project structure

## Running in Eclipse

1. Import the folder as an existing Eclipse project.
2. Add the JavaFX SDK to the project build path or module path.
3. Run `studentmanagement.app.Main` as a JavaFX application.

## Notes

This repository follows a package-based organization and is intended to grow into a full desktop student information system with separate modules for data management, reporting, and validation.
